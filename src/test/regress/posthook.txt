# The format of posthook configuration file
# ( hook_name test_case * )?

# The empty or incorruption file has no effect, we simply ignore the posthook.
# The hook name is the first non-empty name in the file. The remainings are
# a set of test cases we want to run the hook.
# If we only provide the hook name, we run the hook after every test case/group.


# posthook script
# We use this one as the posthook script
 check_status

# If we want to run the hook after a set of test cases, we put the set of
# test cases below. One test case per line.

# test1
# test2
